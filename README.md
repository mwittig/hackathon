# Hyperledger for Public Education and Job Certificates


## Use Case


### Actors 

Angel from India has finished her studies at the Univerty of Delhi and is now applying for her first job in the UK. Thanks to 
the Public Education Blockchain her certificate can be quickly checked by employees on demand. In the past, this 
process took several weeks to complete as a formal request had to be sent to be sent by mail to the authorities in India.

 
Bob is a HR Manager working for a major bank and has invited Angel amongst other candidates for interviews. For Bob it is
important to be confident to choose the right candidate for the job. As part of this it is important for him to be able 
check certificates on request.  

### Story

At the job interview Bob would like to check Angel's bachelor certificate. Angel has submitted her certificate on paper as
part of the application documentes, however, Bob would like to check authenticity of the certificate including the
grade and the main subjects executed as part of her exams.  Fortunately, using the Public Education Blockchain checking 
is just a matter of minutes while it took weeks in former times.  Bob opens the Public Education Blockchain Web Service
and types in the UID printed on the paper copy of Angel's certificate. As a result of the access request Angel receives 
an SMS with 6-digit one-time PIN required to check the certificate. She passes the PIN to Bob who enters it into the web 
page. Now, Bob's request to check the certrificate is processed the details of the certificate are shown on the screen. 


If Jane gets accepted for the job further records may be added to certify job
qualifications and activities. This may include further education certificates issued
by permissioned organisations and the employer to testify job activities Jane has 
performed as part of her career.

## Value Proposition

 * Certificates on paper may be faked or get lost. Keeping certificates on hyperledger
provides for a single point of truth where credentials are kept. Privacy is 
assured as no one can read Jane's records without her consent, i.e. without an one-time
key Jane will generate for the requestor.
